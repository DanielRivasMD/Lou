- add color & update help on commands
- deprecate useless commands
- change zellij coordinates as percentages
- add command `resize` to resize random floating pane as full height top-right anchored & change its name
- add command `stack` to launch a new tab with stack panes or to stack panes in current tab?
- refactor `lou tab` to take positional arguments & `layout` as a flag
- lou manipulation functions as potential zellij plugins?
- lou roadmap is a good idea, but we must keep the order & format of the file
